Transfer UI for MeeGo Handset UX
=============================

0. About
--------

Transfer UI is an application and a library to communicate with the application
which implement platform-wide consistent view on ongoing transfers from different
applications.

Transfer UI application is accessible over D-BUS interface to spawn UX-specific 
transfer visualization. The actual UI implementation is separated from the rest 
of the framework.

UX-specific transfer visualization UI is implemented as a dynamically loadable module.
The module is loaded by the UX-specific transfer-ui executable and asked to provide
actual UI implementation. This allows to utilize transfers concept across whole platform
while having actual UI visualization of them to follow specific requirements of 
a platform's UX implementation (Handset, Netbook, IVI, etc).
